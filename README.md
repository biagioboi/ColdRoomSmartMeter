[1. Introduction](#Introduction): Problem and a possible solution

## Introduction

This is a project for the exam of Serverless Computing for IoT.

The focus of this project start from the need by the big market or restaurant, that have a lot of cold room, to continuously control them in order to guarantee the food freshness and the customers healthy.

Actually this task is performed manually by an employee; and this could cause an effort for the big companies.

In order to reduce the effort on the work place, we can automatically detect the temperature inside the room by introducing a temperature sensor and then alert the employee if something is going wrong.
