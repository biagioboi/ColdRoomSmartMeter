This is a project for the exam of Serverless Computing for IoT.

The focus of this project start from the need by the big market or restaurant, that have a lot of cold room, to continuously control them in order to guarantee the freshness of products and the customers healthy.
Actually this task is performed manually by an employee; and this could cause an effort for the big companies.
